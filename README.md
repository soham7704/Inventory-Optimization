# 📦 Hyperlocal Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

**End-to-end demand forecasting and inventory optimization project using business KPIs to reduce stockouts, overstocking, and revenue leakage.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **end-to-end analytical solution** for **hyperlocal demand forecasting and inventory optimization**, designed to address real-world supply chain inefficiencies using data-driven KPIs and structured analysis.

The notebook follows a **consulting-style approach**, translating raw operational data into actionable insights that directly support **inventory planning, demand fulfillment, and revenue protection**.

Rather than focusing only on modeling, the project emphasizes **business understanding, KPI design, and decision-making impact**, making it suitable for **industry use cases, analytics portfolios, and senior stakeholder discussions**.

---

## 🎯 Project Motive

Modern supply chains often suffer from:
- Reactive inventory decisions  
- Poor demand visibility at a local level  
- Revenue loss due to stockouts and excess inventory  

The motive of this project is to **shift inventory planning from intuition-based decisions to KPI-driven, demand-led optimization**, enabling businesses to:
- Forecast demand accurately  
- Allocate inventory efficiently  
- Reduce operational and financial risk  

---

## 🧭 Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Analyze historical demand and inventory data at a granular (hyperlocal) level  
- Identify demand patterns, volatility, and inventory mismatches  
- Design **business-relevant KPIs** that guide inventory decisions  
- Highlight **revenue leakage, stockout risk, and overstocking scenarios**  
- Demonstrate how analytics supports **inventory optimization and service level improvement**

## 🏢 Business Problem Statement

Organizations operating in distributed or hyperlocal supply chains face the following challenges:

1. Frequent stockouts of high-demand SKUs, leading to lost sales and poor customer experience  
2. Excess inventory of slow-moving items, increasing holding and obsolescence costs  
3. Lack of demand predictability, resulting in inefficient replenishment cycles  
4. Absence of a unified KPI framework to monitor inventory health and revenue risk  

This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw operational data into **decision-ready insights** through structured KPIs and demand analysis.

## 📊 KPI Framework & Business Rationale

Each KPI used in this project is selected based on **direct business relevance** and its ability to drive operational decisions.

### 🔹 Demand KPIs
- Average Demand  
- Demand Variability  
- Peak Demand Identification  

**Why:**  
These KPIs help identify high-velocity SKUs and demand uncertainty, which are critical for forecasting accuracy and planning safety stock.

---

### 🔹 Inventory Health KPIs
- Stock Availability  
- Inventory Coverage  
- Overstock / Understock Indicators  

**Why:**  
These metrics ensure optimal inventory positioning while minimizing holding costs and avoiding capital lock-in.

---

### 🔹 Revenue Impact KPIs
- Revenue Generated  
- Revenue at Risk  
- Stockout Impact on Revenue  

**Why:**  
These KPIs translate operational inefficiencies into **financial impact**, enabling leadership to prioritize corrective actions.

---

### 🔹 Service Level KPIs
- Fulfillment Capability
- Demand vs Supply Alignment

**Why:**  
They ensure customer demand is met consistently across locations and prevent service-level degradation.
